6pad, the smart and light text editor
At the origin of this text editor, a rising frustration against windows notepad, very fast and very accessible but with missing many important functionalities when doing programming.

For programming, there are of course integrated developpement environments (IDE). But I find them either too slow, too complicated, too inaccessible to screen readers, or simply « usine à gaz » as we commonly call that kind of big piece of shit in french. I prefer work with simple things and the command-line. 
Concerning light editors like Notepad2 and Notepad++,their accessibility isn't sufficiant. 
That's why I decided to create my own text editor, called 6pad.

6pad is a text editor for windows aimed to replace that old notepad.
It has been designed from start to keep its execution speed and its accessibility, but adds important functionnalities related to programming; functionnalities not necessary innovative but quick and practical.

Features
* 100% accessible, because using only standard windows controls
* Small and portable: less than 600 KB, no installation needed
* Quick even when loading and editing big files of several MB (Max. 1 GB)
* Opening multiple files in separate tabs
* Managing 13 encodings and line endings
* Perl compatible regular expression search/replace
* Follow indentation and smart home
* Protection against double-opening and concurrent modifications
* Complete and powerful lua scripting module, allowing to customize the editor to your needs

Since everything has drawbacks, the following features aren't implemented and will probably never be :
* Syntactic coloration
* Priting features
* WYSIWYG features
