Todo list for version 1.5
* Find algorithm to reduce cancel/redo memory consumption; kind of intelligent diff, to replace the existing very trivial memory-consumer algorithm
* Add indentation-aware copy/paste, that can adjust the indentation form and level on paste
* Add indentation security, that disallow writing something that can break it unintantionnally on the beginning of a line
* Add onPaste, onCopy, onCut events
* Completely separate filedir+process API into an independant and optional DLL, to reduce 6pad core size
* Remove executeInBackground: too dangerous, and replace by an optional multithreading-specialized library
